## My First job 

For about a year I have been working at a server at a wedding venue.

I started this job a few years ago but had to find a new job when I moved to brantford.

the people were nice and I got to make my own money which was rewarding.

My favorite memory was when one of my co workers fell in the pond we had behind the venue.

The only thing I did not enjoy about it was it was very long shifts and I would get bored sometimes.

Grade: B+.
