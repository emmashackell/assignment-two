## Adopting my dog.

I adopted a dog for my house in Brantford from the humane society.

This was at the start of this year.

I enjoy always having someone home when my roommates are not.

My favorite memory is when me and my roommates gave him his first bath and he jumped out halfway through so we had to chase him around and try to get him back in the bathtub.

The only thing I do not enjoy is when he tries to chew on my shoes.
